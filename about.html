        <p class="about">Thank you for your interest in my practice. I have counseled children and adults from many environments including school settings, low income neighborhoods, and non-profit agencies. I use a relational and psycho-dynamic framework and cognitive behavioral techniques. Children, adolescents, and adults often struggle with the stress of family, school, relationships, and the work environment. I enjoy helping my clients develop strategies to cope with these pressures. My private practice serves children, adolescents and families, as well as child-parent dyads dealing with depression, anxiety, and recovery from trauma.
I have a background in Infant Parent Mental Health as well as an additional training at the UCSF Child Trauma Center. I work with individuals, families, and schools that have experienced serious trauma and loss. I have special interest in counseling children on the autism spectrum and children with attachment issues.
In addition to counseling, I provide consultation to schools, teachers, and parents. As part of that service, I offer home visits and school observations.</p>
